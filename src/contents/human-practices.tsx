          <hr />
          <p>
            At iGEM we believe societal considerations should be upfront and
            integrated throughout the design and execution of synthetic biology
            projects. “Human Practices” refers to iGEM teams' efforts to
            actively consider how the world affects their work and their work
            affects the world. Through your Human Practices activities, your
            team should demonstrate how you have thought carefully and
            creatively about whether your project is responsible and good for
            the world. We invite you to explore issues relating (but not
            limited) to the ethics, safety, security, and sustainability of your
            project, and to show how this exploration feeds back into your
            project purpose, design, and execution.
          </p>

            Please note you can compete for the Silver Medal criterion #2 and
